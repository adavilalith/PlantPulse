## Project Description

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant images from the Plant Village dataset. The goal is to classify various plant diseases based on their visual symptoms. This can assist in early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately helping to improve agricultural productivity and plant health.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Plant Village dataset, which contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. The dataset includes various plant species and categories of diseases, providing a diverse set of training examples for the CNN model.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The CNN model classifies plant images into categories such as healthy, diseased, or infected with specific plant diseases.
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in differentiating between healthy and infected plants.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing the training process, model performance, and sample predictions.
